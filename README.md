Mod to add an personalized audioguide to minetest that plays only one sound.

To use it 
Change the name (audioguideblocklk1) to the name you want to make it easier for you to find the block.
Change the name of the audio-file and the texture to the one you want.

Use /giveme audioguide:audioguideblocklk1 (or your name) to get the block.

When you set and punch the block, the sound can be heard. There is only one instance of the sound playing, so another punch of any person stops the sound and you have to restart it again.
